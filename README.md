# Adaptive Partitioning EDF in the Linux Kernel
Final project for the course in [Advanced Kernel Programming @ Scuola Superiore 
Sant'Anna](https://retis.santannapisa.it/luca/AKP/).

## Description
This patch implements the a2pEDF scheduler (1) in place
of the previous gEDF.
a2pEDF's goal is to reduce the number of migrations of a
SCHED_DEADLINE task. To do so, it prevents pushes when
the current runqueue is not full and the target run queue is
chosen based on avalable bandwidth (instead of later deadline).
Pulls are allowed only by an empty runqueue and only from a
overloaded runqueue.

The patch has been tested on top of v5.9.8.
